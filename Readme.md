## Creational Patterns
   ### Singleton design pattern
      - Only a Single instance of a class is shared among all.
   ### Factory design pattern
      - The Factory Method Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, allowing subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. This pattern is particularly useful when the exact types of objects to be created may vary or need to be determined at runtime, enabling flexibility and extensibility in object creation.
