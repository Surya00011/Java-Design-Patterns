# Design Patterns

Welcome to **Java Design Patterns** repo

The design patterns is communicating objects and classes that are customized to solve a general design problem in a particular context.

## Creational Patterns
   ### Singleton design pattern
      - Only a Single instance of a class is shared among all.
   ### Factory design pattern
      - The Factory Method Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, allowing subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. This pattern is particularly useful when the exact types of objects to be created may vary or need to be determined at runtime, enabling flexibility and extensibility in object creation.
   ### Abstract Factory design Pattern
      -The Abstract Factory Pattern is one of the creational design patterns that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes and implementation, in simpler terms the Abstract Factory Pattern is a way of organizing how you create groups of things that are related to each other.
   ### Builder design Pattern
      - This Pattern is used to build custom complex objects

## Structural Patterns
   ### Decorator design pattern
      - The Decorator Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows behavior to be added to individual objects dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. It involves creating a set of decorator classes that are used to wrap concrete components.
   ### Adapter design pattern
      - One structural design pattern that enables the usage of an existing class's interface as an additional interface is the adapter design pattern. To make two incompatible interfaces function together, it serves as a bridge. This pattern involves a single class, the adapter, responsible for joining functionalities of independent or incompatible interfaces.

## Behavioral Patterns
   ### Observer design pattern
      -The Observer Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects. When one object (the subject) changes state, all its dependents (observers) are notified and updated automatically.
